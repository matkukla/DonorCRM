Hello {{ user.first_name }},

{{ count }} of your donors may be at risk of lapsing.

These donors have given multiple times in the past but haven't given in over 60 days:

{% for contact in contacts %}
- {{ contact.full_name }} (Last gift: {{ contact.last_gift_date }}, Total given: ${{ contact.total_given }})
{% endfor %}

Consider reaching out to reconnect with these supporters.
